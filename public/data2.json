      "review": "The idea is very cool, but I just don't see the use case for these. The main times I would wear bigger headphones like this is either while working (inside), at an airport (inside), or on a plane (inside). Maybe I'm unique, but if I'm out and about, I'm definitely wearing earbuds, not big, bulky on ear cans.\r\n",

The noise cancellation is amazing as well. The sound quality I feel could be better for $200, but overall I'm satisfied.\r\n",
